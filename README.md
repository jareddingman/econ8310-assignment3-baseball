# Assignment 3 (Jared Dingman and Zach Edwards)
## Econ 8310 - Business Forecasting

This is a repo for taking export CVAT xml files in conjunction with frames to make "Baseball" predictions. Dusty, please see the file marked assingment3.py for our graded pytorch dataloder and model.

To run the model:
see the attached model.pt in order to load the trained model
use this link to access the video frames onedrive: https://1drv.ms/u/c/05c6d5d923208e21/EQBn9WFBmFpCh3K-y5oLeREBVM1de63H1SHe-ReVxJyWhw?e=l6T52c
- you will need to download this if you want to run the full model

Some checks you can make on your own:
- Can your custom loader import a new video or set of videos?
- Does your script train a neural network on the assigned data?
- Did your script save your model?
- Do you have separate code to import your model for use after training?
